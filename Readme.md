Welcome to the **Robotic Arm Software** project! This repository contains a Code::Blocks project for developing and simulating robotic arm control algorithms. The project is purely software-based, focusing on tasks like motion planning, kinematics, and simulation, with no hardware dependencies. It’s designed for developers, researchers, or students interested in robotics software development.

## Project Overview
This project provides a foundation for robotic arm control software, built using the Code::Blocks IDE. It includes configuration files to streamline development and is ideal for:
- Simulating robotic arm movements in a virtual environment.
- Implementing and testing forward and inverse kinematics algorithms.
- Developing control strategies for robotic arms.
- Experimenting with trajectory planning or path optimization.

The project is lightweight, modular, and extensible, making it suitable for educational purposes, research, or hobbyist projects.

## Features
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized to support easy addition of new algorithms or modules.
- **Code::Blocks Integration**: Pre-configured project file (`Roboticarm.cbp`) for quick setup.
- **Software-Only**: No hardware required, focusing on simulation and algorithm development.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, or macOS via Code::Blocks.
- **Extensible**: Ready for integration with libraries like Eigen (for linear algebra) or SFML (for visualization).

## Repository Structure
```
RoboticArmProject/
├── Roboticarm.cbp        # Code::Blocks project file for the robotic arm software
├── Roboticarm.layout     # Code::Blocks workspace layout configuration
├── README.md             # Project documentation (this file)
└── src/                  # Placeholder for source files (e.g., .cpp, .h)
```

*Note*: The `src/` folder is a placeholder for source code files (e.g., `main.cpp`, `kinematics.h`). Add your implementation files to this folder and update this README accordingly.

## Requirements
- **Code::Blocks IDE** (version 20.03 or later recommended)
- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC, typically included with Code::Blocks)
- Optional (depending on your implementation):
  - **Eigen** (for advanced linear algebra, if used)
  - **Boost** (for utility functions, if used)
  - **SFML** (for graphical simulation, if used)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulkumar1/RoboticArmProject.git
   cd RoboticArmProject
   ```

2. **Install Code::Blocks**:
   - Download and install Code::Blocks from [codeblocks.org](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads).
   - Ensure a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC) is installed. On Windows, MinGW is included with Code::Blocks; on Linux, install `g++`.

3. **Open the Project**:
   - Launch Code::Blocks.
   - Select `File > Open` and choose `Roboticarm.cbp` from the cloned repository.

4. **Install Optional Dependencies** (if applicable):
   - If your code uses libraries like Eigen or SFML, follow their installation guides:
     - Eigen: [eigen.tuxfamily.org](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
     - SFML: [sfml-dev.org](https://www.sfml-dev.org)

## Usage
1. **Configure the Project**:
   - In Code::Blocks, verify that the compiler is set (e.g., GCC) via `Settings > Compiler`.
   - Check build targets (Debug or Release) in the `Roboticarm.cbp` project settings.
   - If `Roboticarm.layout` doesn’t load your preferred workspace, adjust and save your layout.

2. **Build and Run**:
   - Build the project: Press `Ctrl+F9` or select `Build > Build`.
   - Run the executable: Press `F9` or select `Build > Run`.
   - If no source code is present, add your implementation (e.g., `src/main.cpp`) and rebuild.

3. **Customize and Extend**:
   - Add source files to the `src/` folder for your robotic arm algorithms (e.g., kinematics, trajectory planning).
   - Update `Roboticarm.cbp` in Code::Blocks to include new files: `Project > Add files`.
   - Modify `Roboticarm.layout` to save your workspace preferences (e.g., open files, window positions).

4. **Example Workflow**:
   - Implement a forward kinematics solver in `src/kinematics.cpp`.
   - Test it in `src/main.cpp` with sample joint angles.
   - Output results to the console or a graphical window (if using SFML).
   - Commit changes to the repository.
