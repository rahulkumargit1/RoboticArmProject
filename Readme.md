## Project Overview
This project provides a foundation for robotic arm control software, developed using the Code::Blocks IDE. It includes project configuration files and layout settings to streamline development. The software is designed for tasks like:
- Simulating robotic arm movements.
- Implementing forward and inverse kinematics.
- Testing control algorithms in a virtual environment.

## Features
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized for easy extension (e.g., adding new control algorithms).
- **Code::Blocks Integration**: Pre-configured project file for quick setup.
- **No Hardware Required**: Purely software-based, ideal for simulation or algorithm development.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, or macOS via Code::Blocks.
